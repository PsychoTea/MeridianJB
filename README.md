Feel free to create a PR if you believe there is area for improvement - it's not perfect I know.

## Building

Clone repo, open Xcode project, target your device (or generic), and **make sure ldid is in $PATH**. /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /bin, ~/bin, whatever, make sure it's present. You'll also need tar, but I'd like to assume everyone has that already ;)
